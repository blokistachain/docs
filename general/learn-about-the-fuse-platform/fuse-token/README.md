# Blokista Token (BCC)

The BCC token is the native currency of the Blokista blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## BCC utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Blokista blockchain, BCC is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Blokista to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.bccscan.com/](https://status.bccscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked BCC. Which means validators with higher amounts of Blokista staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any BCC holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of BCC they wish. They receive a share of the Blokista block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As BCC is the native currency on Blokista, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, BCC transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of BCC tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Blokista platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;

At the moment, the BCC token is sometimes used by the project team to power liquidity rewards (yield farming) programs to boost liquidity on DEXes and the participation in the [Blokista Lending Network](./#fuse-utility).

The ongoing liquidity rewards programs on DEXes can be discovered [here](https://app.voltage.finance/index.html#/farm/39656).
