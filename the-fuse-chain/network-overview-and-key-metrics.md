# Network Overview and Key Metrics

Blokista is the decentralized public blockchain that powers the Blokista ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of Blokista.

The Blokista blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake \(dPoS\) for achieving consensus. The consensus is currently secured by 39 validators, only one of which is run by the Blokista core team.

The blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on Blokista is currently around 5 seconds, and it costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.

The following information will help you discover and connect to the Blokista blockchain:
